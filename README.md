# Divisible-Sum-Pairs
This code solves the Divisible Sum Pairs problem by counting pairs of array elements whose sum is divisible by a given integer. The code uses nested loops to check all possible pairs (i, j) where i < j, incrementing a counter whenever the sum of the pair is evenly divisible by k.
